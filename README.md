U-Net is a specific kind of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is mainly utilized for image segmentation tasks. It was created by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in 2015. Originally intended for biomedical image segmentation, it has now found applications in various other fields. The CVC-ClinicDB dataset will be used for this project. This dataset is mainly used for segmenting colonoscopic images, especially in the field of medical image analysis, to help detect and segment polyps. It has been extensively utilized in the development and assessment of image segmentation algorithms, particularly those that use U-Net architectures.The dataset focuses on colonoscopy images, aiming to identify and segment polyps—abnormal growths in the colon—from endoscopic visuals. Early detection of these polyps is crucial for preventing colorectal cancer.
The U-Net architecture is widely used for polyp segmentation tasks on the CVC-ClinicDB due to its ability to effectively capture both global context and fine details. This is made possible by its distinctive contracting and expanding pathways, which include skip connections. As a result, researchers often investigate different U-Net variants or modify its structural design to enhance the accuracy of polyp segmentation in these medical images.
